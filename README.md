# MiniKube_Setup

While setting up Kubernetes using the minikube cluster, at the time or starting minikube on windows 11 if you got this errors so I came up with the solutions, this error is saying in my BIOS virtualizations in on enabled even in my system I am running a VM machine means the virtualizations is enabled, or you can check from task manager, open task manager and go to performance section where you will see the virtualization is enabled or not, if not then go to you BIOS and enabled it.

C:\Windows\System32>minikube start --driver virtualbox
* minikube v1.34.0 on Microsoft Windows 11 Home Single Language 10.0.22631.4317 Build 22631.4317
* Using the virtualbox driver based on user configuration
* Starting "minikube" primary control-plane node in "minikube" cluster
* Creating virtualbox VM (CPUs=2, Memory=2200MB, Disk=20000MB) ...
! StartHost failed, but will try again: creating host: create: precreate: This computer doesn't have VT-X/AMD-v enabled. Enabling it in the BIOS is mandatory
* Creating virtualbox VM (CPUs=2, Memory=2200MB, Disk=20000MB) ...
* Failed to start virtualbox VM. Running "minikube delete" may fix it: creating host: create: precreate: This computer doesn't have VT-X/AMD-v enabled. Enabling it in the BIOS is mandatory

X Exiting due to HOST_VIRT_UNAVAILABLE: Failed to start host: creating host: create: precreate: This computer doesn't have VT-X/AMD-v enabled. Enabling it in the BIOS is mandatory
* Suggestion: Virtualization support is disabled on your computer. If you are running minikube within a VM, try '--driver=docker'. Otherwise, consult your systems BIOS manual for how to enable virtualization.

# Solutions of this errors
in your system is virtualization is already enabled, and by this error we can understand that our minikube is checking the virtualization so we have to disabled this we don't need to check it so for this use --no-vtx-check option

# minikube start --driver virtualbox --no-vtx-check 
this command might resolve this issue
